# Context Broker Manager

APIs to interact with the ``Context Broker``'s database. Through a **REST** Interface, it exposes data and events stored in the internal storage system in a structured way. It provides uniform access to the capabilities of monitoring agents.

## Data Model

![Data Model](data_model.png)

Each table in the figure represents an *index* in the Elastic nomenclature. Considering the *NoSQL* nature of the Elasticsearch engine for each document of any indices it is possible to add additional properties. The schema is not static and defined at priori, but it is dynamic allowing the possibility to add custom properties for a specific document. Elastic requires the name of the index in a lowercase format. For this reason, all the index names follow the *dash-case*[^1] format. Instead, each property[^2] follows the snake-case[^3] format. All the properties marked with an asterisk (*) are required by the APIs in order to make the POST request (i.e. to create a new resource, for example an ExecEnv). Instead the ones underlined are identifies the specific resource (aka document in Elastic nomenclature or record in traditional DB one) and must be unique.

The *data* index contains the all the data collected from the ExecEnvs by means of the agent[^4]. The common attributes are:

1. *id* (unique identifier)[^5];
2. *id* of the source ExecEnv (*exec_env_id*); and
3. *id* of the agent instance that collect the data (*agent_instance_id*).

The ID property type accepts only lower-case values without space that start with an alphabetic character, e.g: apache is valid but not Apache.
Then, the other two properties are related to the time-stamp:

1. *timestamp_event* when event is occurred; and

2. *timestamp_agent* when the agent instance collect the data.

With the term agent instance, we refer to a specific agent installed in the ExecEnv.

The *exec-env* index contains the *hostname* of the remote host where is it allocated and the *type_id* field that correspond a specified type of ExecEnv. The different type of ExecEnv are defined with the index exec-env-type. Currently, the available ones are: *i*) *Virtual Machine* and *ii*) *Container*. Obviously, it is possible to add other types depending on the specific requirements.

The *agent-catalog* index contains specific information related to the agents, and in particular the Beats of the Elastic stack and eBPF-based services deployed with the *Polycube* framework. For a detailed description of these properties see [^6] and [^7]. Each agent in the catalog is characterized by one or more options. The options are defined with the *agent-option* *nested-index*[^8]. This index described the option in terms of name and relative type. At this moment, the supported types are: *integer* (e.g. 1, 2, etc.), *number* (e..g 1, 2.3, etc.); *time-duration* (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h, etc.); *string*; *choice*, *obj*, and *boolean* (i.e. true or false). There two additional (and optional) properties: *list* and *values*. The first one indicate if the option is a list or not (default value: false); while the latter one described the data in the case the type is choice or obj. To accept different types, the values property can be of any type.

All the data of the installed agent is stored in the *agent-instance* index. This index contains the options got from the catalog with the actual values. In addition, it includes the ID of the ExecEnv where the agent is installed (*exec_env_id*) and the current *status* in terms of *started* or *stopped*.

The network links are defined with the relative index where it is indicate the type. All the possible network link types are defined in the *network-link-type* index. At the moment, the possible types are: *Point to Point* (Point 2 Point), *Multi-point*, and *Slice*. Similar to the ExecEnv case, also for the network link, it is possible to add additional types depending on specific needs.

In addition, the data model allow to see the status of the connections between the ExecEnvs. The *connection* index couples the ExecEnv and the network link to which it belongs. This index should contains all the information regarding the network link and the ExecEnv as, for example, the IP address (version 4 and/or 6) or if the link is encrypted and how (which method, etc.).

The *software* index contains the installed software with relative properties. Each software record is referred to a specific ExecEnv that indicate where the software is installed. This part is out of scope of the ASTRID project context and, for this reason, it is this highlighted with a dashed box. The API implementation does not consider this index. Nervelessness, it represents a typical solution for various common cases. The proposed data model allows the customization with the integration of additional entities in very simple way.
